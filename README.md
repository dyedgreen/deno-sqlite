This is an SQLite module for JavaScript. The wrapper is targeted at [Deno](https://deno.land)
and uses a version of SQLite3 compiled to WebAssembly (WASM). This module focuses on ease of use
and performance.

This module guarantees API compatibility according to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Please
report any issues you encounter.

## Documentation

Documentation is available as a [website][docs-web], on [Deno Docs][docs-deno], or in the
[`docs`](./docs/README.md) folder.

## Example

```javascript
import { DB } from "https://deno.land/x/sqlite/mod.ts";

// Open a database
const db = new DB("test.db");
db.query("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS people (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT)");

const names = ["Peter Parker", "Clark Kent", "Bruce Wayne"];

// Run a simple query
for (const name of names)
  db.query("INSERT INTO people (name) VALUES (?)", [name]);

// Print out data in table
for (const [name] of db.query("SELECT name FROM people"))
  console.log(name);

// Close connection
db.close();
```

## Comparison to Plugin based Modules

### TL;DR
If you just want something that works, use this library. If you need serious speed,
or really need to take full advantage of SQLites persistence guarantees and want to
use something like WAL, use a plugin based module like the awesome
[deno_sqlite_plugin](https://github.com/crabmusket/deno_sqlite_plugin).

### Advantages
- Security: benefit from Denos security settings, without the need to trust a third party
- Portability: runs everywhere Deno runs and can even run in the browser
- Easy: takes full advantage of Denos module cache and does not require any network access after initial download

### Disadvantages
- Speed: file system IO through Deno can be significantly lower compared to what is achievable using a native binary
- Weaker Persistence Guarantees: due to limitations in Denos file system APIs, SQLite can't acquire file locks or
  memory map files, which makes some persistence guarantees less strong (e.g. this module can't safely use WAL mode)
- The entire database file is loaded into memory, operated on, then saved back to disk again
